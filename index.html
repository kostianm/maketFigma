            <h3>About Olga</h3>
            <p>I was born in Kiev, Ukraine and I was very active child – I love sports.
                At the age of 13 I joined fitness class.I quickly became interested learning everything I could about
                nutrition. I
                tested many diets, especially those that were scientifically proven. I should say it was not so easy for
                me to change my
                food habits completely. I was practicing yoga for several years. I even tried vegetarian diet. I learned
                to stay
                disciplined, determined and goal minded. As a result of my determination, felt healthier, energized,
                happy and inspired
                to reach higher goals and standards for myself.
                In 2006 I began lifting serious weights and with assistance of yoga, and nutritionally rich meals, I
                noticed how my body
                began to change fast. I concentrated on better understanding how protein functions in the body and the
                effects of proper
                diet application. I became an expert.
                Despite challenges in live, such us destroyed marriage followed by depression and other general
                complications associated
                with living in poor country, I remained motivated and goal oriented. Workouts at the gym kept me focused
                on my goals.

                    <p>So this is me around a year ago on the left. My weight is about 230 lbs. I've maintained this
                        super unhealthy weight for
                        about two years and couldn’t really do much about it. I lived and Europe and ate unhealthy,
                        irregular and junk.
                        I think it was around February when I met my amazing trainer- Olga.
                        This day changed my life to the better and believe it or not I hate writing reviews orcomments
                        but this is a life
                        miracle
                        . This is me on the right today. My weight is 206lbs and this is definitely not the end result.
                        I didn't workout
                        constantly because of my work schedule and chaotic life moments, but this is where we are now.
                        Do I feel better? Yes! Do
                        I want to lose more and gain more myself? Hell Yeah! This is not even a mid point but I am very
                        happy! Olga is a great
                        trainer and a life coach. She is always there for me. she helped me to be present in the moment
                        and most importantly she
                        motivated me to believe in myself! I am thankful for this meeting and after seeing results, I
                        want to get better and
                        better. Hold me accountable guys!
